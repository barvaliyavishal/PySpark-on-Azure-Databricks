# MAGIC ### Step 1: Preview the data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let us first preview the data.

# COMMAND ----------

display(students_df)

# COMMAND ----------

students_df.count()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Step 2: Provide the solution
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now come up with the solution by developing the required logic. Once the function is developed, go to the next step to take care of the validation.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import explode, split

def get_unique_reasons(students_df):
    unique_reasons = students_df. \
        select(explode(split('Reason', ', ')).alias('Reason')). \

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Step 3: Validate the function
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let us validate the function by running below cells.
# MAGIC * Here is the expected output.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```python
